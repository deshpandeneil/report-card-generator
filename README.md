# Task 1

This task was performed on a linux pc and I request you to use the same for correct results. The images of students which you have provided won't open on linux for some reason so I went ahead and changed their extension to ".jpg". If you plan to add additional images to test my code please ensure all images are in ".jpg" format.

## Steps to run the code

1. Open the project "task_1" in any python editor of your choice
2. In the terminal of the editor type "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
3. Open the main.py file and run it

## Results

Once you have run the "main.py" file, a folder named "student_data" will appear in the project root directory. This folder contains folders of all students, named after their registration numbers. Inside these folders you will find the "report.pdf" file which is generated and an "images" folder which stores an image of the table of scores for that students. Other analytical data pertaining to each student can also be stored here. I haven't been able to perform any additional analytics since I'm on a tight schedule.

# Thank you.
